the cnn is developed using tensorflow, the structure : 

1. The first convolution layer has a [m X 28 X 28 X 1] input , with 8 Filters of size [3 X 3 X 1] and "same" padding, activaion ='relu'
2. A Max pool with 2 X 2 window and a stride of 2 ,"same" padding.
3. The second convolution layer has with 16 Filters of size [3 X 3 X 8] and "same" padding, activaion ='relu'
4. A Max pool with 2 X 2 window and a stride of 2 ,"same" padding.
5. A 128 unit fullyl connected layer with dropout
6. A fully connected linear activation function, with 10 neurons in the output layer. which is later passed as logit in calculation of categorical crossentropy



the dataset is a standard MNIST dataset with:
60000 training data
10000 testing data

each image of size 28X28



RESULTS
TRAINING ACCURACY :99.66 %
TESTING ACCURACY  :98.75 %
